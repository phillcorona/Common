/**
 * String Comparison in C
 *
 * In C, comparing two strings lexicographically means comparing them 
 * character by character, based on the ASCII values of their characters.
 * This comparison continues until one of the following conditions is met:
 * - A difference is found between corresponding characters.
 * - The end of one or both strings is reached (null terminator '\0').
 *
 * Two common approaches for comparing strings:
 *
 * 1. **Array Indexing Approach**:
 *    - Uses an integer index to access the characters of both strings.
 *    - The loop continues as long as the characters at the current index 
 *      in both strings match, and neither string has reached its null 
 *      terminator.
 *    - After the loop, the difference between the ASCII values of the 
 *      first mismatched characters is returned.
 *    - **Advantages**:
 *      - Clear and easy to understand for beginners.
 *      - Explicit about how strings are compared using indices.
 *    - **Disadvantages**:
 *      - Slightly less efficient, as repeated array indexing can incur overhead.
 *      - Requires an additional variable (the index) to traverse the strings.
 *
 * 2. **Pointer Arithmetic Approach**:
 *    - Uses pointers to directly reference the characters in the strings.
 *    - The loop continues as long as the characters pointed to by the 
 *      pointers match and neither is the null terminator.
 *    - After the loop, the function returns the difference between the ASCII 
 *      values of the first differing characters.
 *    - **Advantages**:
 *      - More efficient, as it avoids the overhead of array indexing.
 *      - More compact and requires fewer variables.
 *    - **Disadvantages**:
 *      - Can be less intuitive for beginners, especially when working with pointers.
 *
 * **Performance Considerations**:
 * - The pointer arithmetic approach is generally faster because it 
 *   directly manipulates pointers, reducing the number of instructions 
 *   required compared to array indexing.
 * - The array indexing approach may have a minor performance hit due to 
 *   repeated memory access via index calculations, although the difference 
 *   may be negligible for small strings.
 *
 * **Recommendation**:
 * - For performance and conciseness, use the pointer arithmetic approach.
 * - For clarity, especially when teaching or debugging, the array indexing 
 *   approach may be preferable.

 /**
 * Pointers vs Arrays in Functions
 *
 * In C, both pointers and arrays are commonly used to handle sequences of data, 
 * like strings or collections of variables. Understanding the differences between 
 * them and how they behave in functions is key to writing efficient and correct code.
 *
 * 1. **Arrays**:
 *    - An array is a contiguous block of memory that holds multiple elements of 
 *      the same type.
 *    - The array variable itself is essentially a pointer to the first element 
 *      of the array. However, in most contexts, arrays are not "true" pointers.
 *    - **Passing Arrays to Functions**:
 *      - When you pass an array to a function, it is treated as a pointer to the 
 *        first element of the array.
 *      - **Important**: Array size information is lost when passed to a function. 
 *        The function will not know the arrayâ€™s length unless it is explicitly 
 *        passed as an additional parameter.
 *      - Example: `void foo(int arr[])` or `void foo(int *arr)` both accept an 
 *        array, but in both cases, `arr` is treated as a pointer to `int`.
 *    - **Limitations**:
 *      - Arrays cannot be resized after their declaration.
 *      - They decay into pointers when passed to functions, which means the 
 *        array is implicitly passed by reference, allowing modifications inside 
 *        the function.
 *      
 * 2. **Pointers**:
 *    - A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
 *    - Pointers are more flexible than arrays because they can be assigned, 
 *      incremented, and decremented to point to different memory locations.
 *    - **Passing Pointers to Functions**:
 *      - Pointers are passed to functions by reference. This means the function 
 *        can modify the original data (e.g., change the value of the variable it 
 *        points to).
 *      - When passing pointers, the function knows where the data is located, 
 *        so you can pass large data structures like arrays efficiently.
 *      - **Dynamic Memory**: Pointers can point to dynamically allocated memory 
 *        (using `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`), making them suitable for 
 *        managing memory at runtime.
 *    - **Advantages**:
 *      - Pointers allow more flexibility compared to arrays. You can resize 
 *        memory dynamically or even create complex data structures like linked 
 *        lists, trees, etc.
 *      - You can use pointers to navigate through memory efficiently.
 *    - **Limitations**:
 *      - Pointers are more prone to errors like dereferencing `NULL` or accessing 
 *        memory beyond the allocated area (leading to memory corruption or crashes).
 *      - Pointer arithmetic, while powerful, requires careful handling.
 *
 * 3. **Key Differences Between Pointers and Arrays**:
 *    - **Memory Handling**:
 *      - Arrays have a fixed size defined at compile time, while pointers can 
 *        point to dynamically allocated memory, allowing more flexible memory 
 *        management.
 *      - Arrays are contiguous in memory, whereas pointers can be used to reference 
 *        non-contiguous blocks of memory (e.g., heap-allocated memory).
 *
 *    - **Pass-by-Reference vs Pass-by-Value**:
 *      - Arrays decay to pointers when passed to functions, meaning they are 
 *        effectively passed by reference, allowing changes to be reflected 
 *        outside the function.
 *      - Pointers passed to functions also act as pass-by-reference, which is 
 *        why they can modify the data they point to.
 *
 *    - **Resizing**:
 *      - Arrays have a fixed size, meaning you cannot resize them once they are 
 *        declared (unless dynamically allocated).
 *      - Pointers can dynamically manage memory, using `malloc`, `calloc`, and 
 *        `realloc`, which allows resizing and freeing memory as needed.
 *
 * 4. **Practical Considerations**:
 *    - **Function Argument Types**:
 *      - When writing functions, using pointers as arguments is more versatile, 
 *        as you can pass large structures (like arrays or dynamically allocated 
 *        memory) without duplicating data.
 *      - Example: 
 *        ```c
 *        void process_array(int *arr, size_t size);
 *        ```
 *        In this case, the function knows that `arr` is a pointer to an `int` 
 *        and can manipulate the data directly.
 *    - **Pointer Arithmetic**:
 *      - Pointer arithmetic allows you to navigate through memory locations 
 *        efficiently, making it ideal for operations on arrays or other data 
 *        structures.
 *      - Example:
 *        ```c
 *        for (int *ptr = arr; ptr < arr + size; ptr++) {
 *            printf("%d ", *ptr);
 *        }
 *        ```
 *        Here, `ptr` moves through the array using pointer arithmetic.
 *
 * 5. **Common Pitfalls**:
 *    - Dereferencing invalid pointers (e.g., `NULL` or out-of-bounds memory).
 *    - Forgetting to `free` dynamically allocated memory, leading to memory leaks.
 *    - Using pointers and arrays interchangeably can be confusing if not done 
 *      carefully. Remember that arrays decay to pointers when passed to functions.
 *
 * **Recommendation**:
 * - **Use Arrays**:
 *      - For fixed-size sequences of data when the size is known at compile time 
 *        and the array won't need to be resized.
 * - **Use Pointers**:
 *      - When dealing with dynamically allocated memory, large data structures, 
 *        or when flexibility is needed to manipulate memory locations.
